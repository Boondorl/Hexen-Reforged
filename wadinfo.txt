Description             : Universal damage numbers mod for Doom engine
                          games. 'Nuff said.

                          Load this alongside any GZDoom-supported IWAD
                          (or stick it in your autoloads), shoot some foes,
                          and marvel as little numbers fly out. Huzzah!
                          Works independently of other mods, unless they
                          do something very, very silly.

                          Though simple in premise, this mod is chock-full
                          of options, including a wide variety of fonts
                          and colors to choose from. Make It Your W*sued*

Additional Credits to   : Major Cooke for helping revamp a huge share of
                          the mod's guts into something a bit more sane.
                          Zombie and Marrub for letting me bounce ideas off
                          their head and shooting some advice my way.
                          I'd be quite stuck without these guys pitching in.

May Not Run With...     : Did you know that world-renowned writer Stephen
                          King was once hit by a car? Just something to
                          consider.
